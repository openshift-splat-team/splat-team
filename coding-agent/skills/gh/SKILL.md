# GitHub CLI Skill

Unified interface for GitHub Projects v2 workflows. Manages issues, epics, stories, statuses, milestones, and pull requests with comprehensive error handling and verification.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- `GH_TOKEN` environment variable set (shared team token)
- **`project` token scope** enabled: `gh auth refresh -s project`
- `team/` directory has a GitHub remote
- `.botminter.yml` exists in workspace root (for comment attribution)

**Verification:** Each operation runs `scripts/setup.sh` which validates prerequisites and fails fast with clear errors if requirements aren't met.

## How It Works

All operations follow this pattern:

1. **Setup** - Verify scope, detect repo, cache project IDs
2. **Execute** - Run the operation with input validation
3. **Verify** - Confirm the operation succeeded (for critical ops)
4. **Attribute** - Post timestamped comment showing who did what

Claude will automatically invoke the appropriate script based on your request.

## Operations

### 1. Board View

**When to use:** User asks to show the board, view issues, check status, see what's in progress, or get an overview.

**What it does:**
- Fetches all project items from GitHub Projects v2
- Groups issues by status field value (po:triage, arch:design, dev:ready, etc.)
- Shows epic-to-story relationships via parent labels
- Displays in workflow order with issue counts
- Marks closed issues

**Usage:**

Claude will run:
```bash
bash scripts/board-view.sh
```

Then format the JSON output into a markdown table grouped by status.

**Output format:**
```
## Board

### po:triage
| # | Title | Kind | Assignee |
|---|-------|------|----------|
| 3 | New feature epic | epic | — |

### dev:ready
| # | Title | Kind | Parent | Assignee |
|---|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 5 | Implement OAuth | story | #3 | dev-user |

---
Summary: 5 issues (4 open, 1 closed) | 2 epics, 3 stories
```

---

### 2. Create Issue (Epic or Story)

**When to use:** User asks to create an epic, add a story, file a new issue, or add work to backlog.

**What it does:**
1. Creates issue with appropriate `kind/*` label
2. For stories: adds `parent/<number>` label and "Parent: #N" to body
3. Adds issue to project
4. Sets initial status to `po:triage`
5. Posts attribution comment

**Parameters:**
- `--title` (required) - Issue title
- `--body` (required) - Issue description (markdown)
- `--kind` (required) - `epic` or `story`
- `--parent` (optional) - Parent epic number (for stories)
- `--milestone` (optional) - Milestone name
- `--assignee` (optional) - GitHub username

**Usage:**

Claude will run:
```bash
# Epic
bash scripts/create-issue.sh \
  --title "New authentication system" \
  --body "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication..." \
  --kind epic

# Story under epic
bash scripts/create-issue.sh \
  --title "Add Google OAuth provider" \
  --body "Implement Google OAuth..." \
  --kind story \
  --parent 15
```

**Result:** Issue created, added to project with status `po:triage`, board scanner will process it next.

---

### 3. Status Transition

**When to use:** User asks to move an issue to a different status, transition from one state to another.

**What it does:**
1. Validates issue exists in project (auto-adds if missing)
2. Resolves status option ID from cached field data
3. Updates project item field via gh CLI
4. **Verifies** status changed with GraphQL query (prevents silent failures)
5. Posts attribution comment documenting transition

**Parameters:**
- `--issue` (required) - Issue number
- `--from` (optional) - Current status (for comment attribution)
- `--to` (required) - New status

**Usage:**

Claude will run:
```bash
bash scripts/status-transition.sh \
  --issue 15 \
  --from "po:triage" \
  --to "arch:design"
```

**Critical:** This operation includes GraphQL verification. If the status doesn't actually change, the script fails with details. See [GraphQL Queries](references/graphql-queries.md) for the v3.0.0 fix.

**Result:** Status updated and verified, transition documented in comments.

---

### 4. Add Comment

**When to use:** User asks to comment on an issue, post analysis, add review feedback, or document decisions.

**What it does:**

  --issue 15 \
  --body "Design looks good. Proceeding to implementation planning."
```

---

### 5. Assign / Unassign

**What it does:**
- Adds or removes assignee from issue
- Multiple assignees supported

**Parameters:**
- `--issue` (required) - Issue number

  --issue 15 \
  --action unassign \
  --user architect-bot
```

---

### 6. Milestone Management

**When to use:** User asks to list milestones, create a milestone, or assign issue to milestone.

**What it does:**
- Lists all milestones with state and due dates
- Creates new milestones
- Assigns issues to milestones

**Parameters:**

## Examples

### Example 1: Create and Triage an Epic

**User says:** "Create an epic for the new authentication system"

**Actions:**
1. Claude runs `create-issue.sh` with `--kind epic`
2. Issue added to project with initial status `po:triage`
3. Attribution comment posted
4. Reports issue number and URL

**Result:** Epic created at #15, visible in `po:triage` column on board, ready for PO review.

---

### Example 2: Move Issue Through Workflow

**User says:** "Move issue #15 from triage to design"

**Actions:**
1. Claude runs `status-transition.sh` with `--to "arch:design"`
2. Script validates current status
3. Updates status via gh CLI
4. Verifies with GraphQL query that status actually changed
5. Posts attribution comment documenting transition

**Result:** Issue #15 now in `arch:design` status, verified with GraphQL, transition documented.

---

### Example 3: View Project Board

**User says:** "Show me what's on the board"

**Actions:**
1. Claude runs `board-view.sh`
2. Receives JSON with all project items
3. Formats into markdown table grouped by status
4. Shows epic-to-story relationships

**Result:** Complete board view with issues grouped by workflow status, ready for scanning.

---

### Example 4: Create Story Under Epic

**User says:** "Add a story under epic #15 for implementing OAuth provider"

## References

For detailed documentation:

- **[Status Lifecycle](references/status-lifecycle.md)** - Epic and story workflow states, human gates, rejection loops
- **[Error Handling](references/error-handling.md)** - Patterns used across all scripts, validation, verification
- **[GraphQL Queries](references/graphql-queries.md)** - Verification query details, v3.0.0 fix for variable types
- **[Troubleshooting](references/troubleshooting.md)** - Common errors and solutions

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing 'project' scope on GH_TOKEN"

**Solution:**
```bash
gh auth refresh -s project
gh auth status  # Verify scope is enabled
```

### Error: "Status verification failed"

**Cause:** Status didn't actually change despite gh CLI success

**Solution:**
1. Verify token has `project` scope
2. Check rate limits: `gh api rate_limit`
3. Retry the operation

See [Troubleshooting Guide](references/troubleshooting.md) for complete error reference.

---

## Notes

- **Token scope:** The `project` scope is required for all project operations. Verified at start of every script.
- **Idempotent:** All operations are safe to retry. Re-setting same status, re-assigning same user is safe.
- **Rate limits:** The gh CLI respects GitHub's rate limits. For bulk operations, add delays between calls.
- **Error handling:** v3.0.0 includes comprehensive validation and verification. All failures are caught and reported with detailed context.
- **Auto-recovery:** Scripts automatically handle common issues like missing project items.
